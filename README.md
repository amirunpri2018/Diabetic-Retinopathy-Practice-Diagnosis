Many nurses work on the front lines of blindness prevention in regions where there's a shortage of trained ophthalmologists. I created this online tool to help these nurses improve their diabetic retinopathy diagnosis skills.

### Dataset

The dataset is part of the APTOS 2019 Blindness Detection Kaggle competition.<br>
